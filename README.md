# capstoneFE

Welcome to my Capstone Project!

This is the Front End side of my Capstone Project called GigFinder.
GigFinder is a website I designed to act as a hub for artists, promoters, and venues to connect and collaborate with each other.

In this app you will be able to sign up and log in to page. Once you are logged in you have access to a Google calendar and map in your dashboard. There will be a tab for events where Gigs can be posted to for users to find the connections they are searching for.

To run this application, you must download all the files in this repository. 

Once everything is downloaded, opne your terminal within the CapstoneFE worspace and 'cd' into the front end folder with the command below.

cd Frontend

Once you are in the Frontend folder you can run the application with this command:

npm run dev

That will run the front end part of this application. For full functionality you must also run the backend folder simultaneoulsy which can be downloaded from this repository:

Enjoy!
